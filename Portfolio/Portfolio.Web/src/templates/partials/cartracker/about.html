<p>Car Tracker is an Android application and web application to track vehicle and trip information. Similar to Strava and MapMyRun, except for your car. The Android application connects to your car's diagnostic system using a Bluetooth OBD-II reader. Once connected it gathers various statistics, (speed, engine speed, oil temperature, air temperate, etc) and records them along with your current GPS position throughout your trip. Once the trip is over they are uploaded to a server and available for viewing. Future plans are to update the server to provide more performance and maintenance information. Such as how fuel efficient your car is and when its due for its next maintenance.</p>
