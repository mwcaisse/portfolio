    I wanted a site that was responsive and quick to load, which led me to chose using Bootstrap and Nunjucks. Bootstrap for easily making a responsive site that  looked nice and Nunjucks for the templating benefits it provided.
</p>
<p>
    The site consists of two template pages both backed by data stored in JSON format. This allows for easily adding more content and updating the look and feel. If I decide I want to change how an experient point looks, I edit the template once and each one is updated.
