    Google exposes an API to send push notifications to all devices that have Google Play Services installed.
    They do not allow you to attach files of arbitrary size to the notifications, my own service was needed to facilitate file download.
</p>

<p>
    The Android application registers itself with Google play services to receive push notifications and sends its registration ID to Push File.
    When it receives a notification, it checks to see if it has any files available for download through a Rest API.
</p>

<p>
    The web application utilizes Spring Framework for dependency injection, creating the RESTFul API, serving web pages using Thymeleaf as a templating engine, and to provide security.
    The web interface utilizes Knockout for templating and data binding, and Bootstrap 3 for styling.

    The source code for the application can be found <a href="https://github.com/mwcaisse/AndroidFT" target="_blank">here</a>.
