    Google exposes an API to send push notifications to all devices that have Google Play Services installed.
    They do not allow you to attach files of arbitrary size to the notifications, my own service was needed to facilitate file download.

<p>
    The andriod application registers itself with Google play services to receive push notifications and sends its registration ID to Push File.
    When it receieves a notification, it checks to see if it has any files availble for download through a Rest API.

    The web application utilizes Spring Framework for dependency injection, creating the RESTFul APi, serving web pagesusing Thymeleaf as a templating engine, and to provide security.
    The web interface utilizes Knockout for templating and databinding, and Bootstrap 4 for styling.
