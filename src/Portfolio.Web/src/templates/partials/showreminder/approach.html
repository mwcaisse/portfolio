<p>I needed a way to look up and find show information, quickly present it to the user, and not constantly request data from show information source.
    I decided upon using <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank">The Movie Database</a> as a source for show information. Their Web API was nicely documented, service is reliable, and contained all of the information I needed.</p>

<p>The caching portion uses Entity Framework and a .NET Core Web API project to search and store show information from The Movie Database.</p>

<p>The user interface was written using Angular 2 and Bootstrap 4, backed by a .NET Core WebMVC Project.</p>

<p>The source code for the application can be found <a href="https://github.com/mwcaisse/ShowReminder" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
