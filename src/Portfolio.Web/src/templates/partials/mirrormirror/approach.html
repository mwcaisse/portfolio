    A Raspberry PI 3 served as the backend for this project. The Raspberry PI was running a minimalist Linux distribution, Arch Linux, OpenBox for a display manager, and Chromium in kiosk mode to display the web application. The web application itself was hosted on a seperate server.
</p>

<p>The web application was a simple single page that refreshed itself periodically to keep the information it displays up to date. It was backed by a RESTFul API that provided an interface to the weather API and fortune.</p>

<p>The source code for the application can be found <a href="https://github.com/mwcaisse/MirrorMirror">here</a>.</p>
